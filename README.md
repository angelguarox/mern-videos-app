# mern-videos-app

## Description

This repository is a practice of the MERN Stack without the M of MongoDB and ends up being the M of MySQL (yes, I did not respect the Stack, sorry).
It is a very small REST API where React is implemented in the Fronted without using the create-react-app client and where it is manually configured for its operation.

## Use

### Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angelguarox/mern-videos-app.git
```

### Go into each folder (backend and frontend)

Raise each server with the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Important note!**

You must have Node.js installed on your computer :)

Finally, you will have both servers turned on and you will be able to access the app from your browser with the URLs that are indicated to you through the terminal or console.
